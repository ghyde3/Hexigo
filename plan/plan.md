# Catan Game Implementation Plan

## Current Status Assessment
The UI looks a little better, but I think we can make it a little better. The spacing isn't great, and we also need something to indicate the active player more clearly. We need a new panel for 3 new components: the log, the bank cards, and the current player's hand of cards and their available resources (roads, towns, cities).

## UI Improvements

### 1. Layout and Spacing
- Adjust the spacing between UI elements for better visual hierarchy
- Ensure consistent padding and margins throughout the interface
- Improve the positioning of draggable panels to avoid overlapping
- Add visual indicators for active player (highlight, animation, etc.)
- Implement a turn timer to keep pace of play (similar to "01:59" in screenshot)
- Create clear action state indicators showing what actions are currently possible

### 2. New Panels
- **Game Log and Chat Panel**:
  - Display game events (dice rolls, resource gains, trades, etc.)
  - Include chat functionality with message input field and send button
  - Scrollable history with timestamps
  - Filter options for different types of events
  - System messages (e.g., "Game Paused", "Game Resumed")

- **Bank/Development Cards Panel**:
  - Show available development cards with remaining counts
  - Display remaining resource counts in the bank
  - Visual indicators for card costs
  - Card stack visualization with quantity indicators (like "19" shown on resource cards)
  - Bank building with visual indicator for development cards

- **Player Hand Panel**:
  - Show current player's development cards
  - Display available building pieces (roads, settlements, cities) with quantity
  - Include building costs reference for quick access
  - Player avatar/profile representation
  - Victory point counter
  - Special card indicators (Longest Road, Largest Army)

### 3. Visual Enhancements
- Add water/ocean texture around the board to create island effect
- Improve hex tile designs with more detailed textures and resource indicators
- Add port graphics at the edges of the board with trade ratio indicators (3:1, 2:1)
- Implement port visualization with boat/ship icons and flags showing trade type
- Create number tokens with probability dots (red for high probability, black for others)
- Implement animations for dice rolls, resource collection
- Add visual feedback for actions (building, trading)
- Add robber token with clear visual presence on the board

## Game Mechanics Implementation

### 1. Core Game Rules
- **Setup Phase**:
  - Initial placement of settlements and roads
  - Starting resource distribution

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Dice rolling and resource production
  - Trading phase (with other players and ports)
  - Building phase
  - Development card playing
  - End turn
  - Turn timer functionality with time limits

- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Track victory points (10 points to win)
  - Display victory point counter for each player

### 2. Resource Management
- Implement resource collection based on dice rolls and hex adjacency
- Resource trading system (player-to-player, player-to-bank, ports)
- Resource stealing (robber)
- Resource limits and discarding
- Visual representation of resource quantities for all players

### 3. Building Mechanics
- Road building with connectivity rules
- Settlement building with distance rules
- City upgrades from settlements
- Development card purchasing and usage
- Clear visual indicators for valid building locations
- Building costs reference visible during placement phase

### 4. Special Features
- **Robber**:
  - Movement mechanics
  - Stealing resources
  - Blocking resource production
  - Visual indicator on hexes

- **Longest Road and Largest Army**:
  - Calculation algorithms
  - Special victory point cards
  - Transfer of special cards when conditions change
  - Visual indicators for who holds these special cards

- **Ports**:
  - 3:1 and 2:1 trading implementation
  - Port placement on the board with distinct visuals
  - Trading interface with port-specific options
  - Port icons with ships/boats and trading ratios as shown in screenshot
  - Visual distinction between different port types (general 3:1 vs resource-specific 2:1)

### 5. Development Cards
- Knight/Soldier cards
- Progress cards (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
- Victory Point cards
- Card usage rules (not on the turn they're purchased)
- Visual design for different card types

## Technical Implementation

### 1. State Management
- Refine game state structure to handle all game elements
- Implement proper state transitions for game phases
- Ensure consistent state updates across all components
- Track and display current game action state

### 2. Interaction System
- Improve click/drag handling for game pieces
- Implement highlighting for valid placement locations
- Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Clear visual feedback for current action state (e.g., "Place Settlement" mode)

### 3. Multiplayer Features
- Turn-based system with proper player rotation
- Trade request and acceptance system
- Spectator mode
- Player profile/avatar customization
- Chat functionality between players

### 4. AI Players (Optional)
- Basic AI for single-player mode
- Different difficulty levels
- AI trading strategies
- AI personality traits
- Visual representation for AI players
