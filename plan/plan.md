# Building a Digital Board Game: Lessons from Hexigo Catan Implementation

## Architecture and Component Design

### Core Architecture Principles
- **Component-Based Design**: Break down the UI into small, reusable components that have a single responsibility.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate game logic from UI components.
- **State Management**: Use a centralized state management approach for game state.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Components should communicate through events and callbacks rather than direct references.
- **Bite-Sized Files**: Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility to enhance maintainability.

### Key Components Structure
1. **Game Container**: The top-level component that coordinates all other components and manages game state.
2. **Game Board**: The central visual component that displays the playable area.
   - **Grid System**: Manages the coordinate system and positioning of elements.
   - **Tile Manager**: Handles rendering and interaction with game tiles.
   - **Port Manager**: Manages special trading locations.
   - **Structure Manager**: Handles placement and rendering of player structures.
3. **Player Interface**: Components for player interaction and information.
   - **Resource Display**: Shows player resources and possessions.
   - **Action Controls**: Provides interface for player actions.
   - **Trading Interface**: Facilitates resource exchanges.
4. **Game Information**: Components that provide game state information.
   - **Game Log**: Records and displays game events.
   - **Bank Panel**: Shows available resources and development cards.
   - **Turn Information**: Displays current player and turn phase.

### Component Development Strategy
- **Start Small**: Begin with small, focused components with a single responsibility.
- **Compositional Design**: Build larger features by composing smaller components.
- **Atomic Design**: Follow atomic design principles (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages).
- **Interface-First**: Define component interfaces before implementation to ensure proper integration.
- **Bridge Files**: If refactoring existing components, create bridge files to maintain backward compatibility.

## Leveraging boardgame.io

### Core Features to Utilize
- **Game State Management**: Use boardgame.io's G object to store and manage all game state.
- **Turn Management**: Leverage the built-in turn order management system.
- **Move Validation**: Use the framework's built-in move validation to enforce game rules.
- **Events API**: Utilize the events API for turn phases, game progression, and player changes.
- **Secret State**: Use the framework's ability to manage secret information in multiplayer games.

### Game Logic Implementation
- **Moves**: Define all game actions as boardgame.io moves to ensure proper state transitions.
- **Phases**: Structure game flow using boardgame.io phases (setup, main game, end game).
- **Turns**: Define turn structure within the boardgame.io framework.
- **Game Over Conditions**: Implement victory conditions using the framework's endIf function.

### Client Integration
- **Client Components**: Use boardgame.io's client components as containers for your UI.
- **Decoupled Rendering**: Keep rendering logic separate from game logic for better testability.
- **Move API Access**: Access moves through the client's provided API rather than directly modifying state.

### Multiplayer Preparation
- **Backend Agnostic Design**: Keep the core game logic independent of the backend implementation.

2. **Player State**: Information about each player (resources, structures, victory points)
3. **UI State**: Visual state not directly related to game rules (panel positions, active views)
4. **Transient State**: Temporary state for ongoing actions (dice roll animations, selected tiles)

### State Persistence
